    <p>
      By accepting the policy, these terms will automatically apply to you – you
      should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the
      app. Our policies are designed to ensure that our community stays
      protected. They set out what's allowed and not allowed on Viral App, and
      apply to all types of content on our platform, including webistes, videos,

      goods and services advertised, it may not be allowed.
